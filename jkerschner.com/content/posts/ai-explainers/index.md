## Why I love AI‑generated explainer webpages

One of my favorite uses of AI is asking Claude to generate entire **explainer webpages** for complicated topics.
Partly because I’m amazed that it works at all, and partly because my humming‑bird attention span **needs** the visual aids to stay locked in.

## Prompt template 

First, ask your question like normal and have the model generate the full explanation. Once it finishes you can follow up with:

```text
Please use this to put together a webpage that illustrates these concepts with diagrams and useful fact cards.  
The target audience would be someone familiar with <parent subject>, but new to <topic>.
```

*(Replace the angle‑bracketed placeholders as needed.)*

## Putting It To The Test: Kubernetes → Kustomize

Here’s a recent prompt I sent to Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini based on some reading I was doing on Kustomize variable replacements:

```text
please use this to put together a webpage that illustrates these concepts with diagrams and useful fact cards.  
The target audience would be someone familiar with *kubernetes*, but new to *kustomize templating*.
```

      (this.dataset.label || this.textContent).trim().toLowerCase().replace(/\\s+/g, "-");
    if (window.goatcounter) {
      goatcounter.count({
        path: "/outbound/explainer-" + label,
        title: "Explainer outbound: " + label
      });
    }
  }
  document
    .querySelectorAll('a[data-outbound="true"]')
    .forEach((a) => a.addEventListener("click", track));
})();

> **First look:** Claude's artifacts appear slightly mis‑aligned, yet compared with the others it's *in a league of its own* for overall structure and diagram quality.

## Key Takeaways

* **Webpage > Wall of Text.** Diagrams and card-based summaries keep scrolling fatigue low.
* **Claude leads in layout,** even if some elements need nudging.
* **Diagrams are Cheap.** It used to be the case that you'd need to google and scour to find diagrams for your specific subject, but now you can have custom diagrams created and tailored to your unique context.
