This question has been hounding me this week...by my estimates the saturation of the latest programming benchmarks was coming as soon as the end of the year, but I stumbled onto something that makes me think we may already be there. The models can score 90+% with a small change in how the benchmark runs.

First, an important note on benchmarks: 
{{< alert "note" >}}
It's just as important to know HOW they produce the results as it is important to know WHAT they are testing. 
{{</ alert >}}

This is a lesson I had to re-learn this week when I attempted to replicate the Aider benchmarks. I was excited to try it with the incredibly cheap Gemini Pro and answer some other 'odd' test cases the website doesn't cover. Aider's polygo is a programming specific benchmark, created at the end of 2024 due to the rapid progress that models have been making in code writing/editing. You can read more about how it was constucted on aider's site: [The polyglot benchmark](https://aider.chat/2024/12/21/polyglot.html#the-polyglot-benchmark)

Here are the current top (single model) results for the Aider leaderboard:

{{< figure src="/images/aider-leaderboard-may-8-2025.jpg" 
    alt="Screenshot of the Aider LLM Leaderboards page showing polyglot coding benchmark results for May 8, 2025. Three models are listed: o3 (high) with 79.6% accuracy and $111.03 cost, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (05-06) with 76.9% accuracy and $37.41 cost, and o4-mini (high) with 72.0% accuracy and $19.64 cost. The leaderboard compares models based on percent correct, cost, command used, and edit format accuracy, with o3 and o4-mini using 'diff' format, and Gemini 2.5 using 'diff-fenced'.

When you see this report of scores between 70% and 80% for the top models and may think:
- The mini does pretty good for its price!
- o3 is way too expensive!
- When you run the models against the 225 practice problems, they'll get 70-80% of them right on the ***first try***

This was my thinking, but that's not *quite* what the leaderboard is showing. Here is the chart showing what was just described with the caveat I don't have price information for only allowing 1 try and was only able to get the pass_1_rate from the site:

{{< figure src="/images/aider-leaderboard-modified-1st-attempt-scores-may-8-2025.jpg" 
    alt="Aider LLM Leaderboards screenshot comparing first-attempt coding benchmark results of o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and o4-mini language models. The table displays percent correct, cost, command used, and code edit format. A label in red text reads: ‘Edited to show the scores from the first attempt pass/fail.’" class="mx-auto" 
>}}
(a fun aside is that when you show the pass at one like this, the unadjusted-cost matches the scores pretty well)

The original graph is showing the pass rate when the models have 2 attempts. Each models is given a chance to correct any mistakes after their first attempt at passing the unit tests. They are given information about what tests failed and what the error logs were and then they are asked to resolve the remaining issues. If the model fails on this second pass the benchmark counts it as a failure. Fair enough, with this new knowledge though, you may also notice a sharp rise in performance when you go from 1 try to 2 tries and wonder:

{{< alert "note" >}}
Does the same pattern repeat when you go from 2 tries up to say, 4? 8? 16?
{{</ alert >}}

{{< figure src="/images/aider-benchmark-performance-trend.jpg" 
    alt="Line chart titled 'Aider Benchmark Results (May 6 '25) – Line go up??', comparing performance across multiple AI models using Pass@k metrics. The chart includes three lines: o3 with GPT-4.1 (high) in blue, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview in green, and o3-mini (high) diff edits in gray. A bold black dotted line extends the Gemini 2.5 Pro trajectory toward a large black dot near 100% at Pass@4, suggesting extrapolated peak performance." 
    class="mx-auto"

To which the answer is...

{{< figure src="/images/aider-benchmark-performance-almost.jpg" 
    alt="Updated line chart titled 'Aider Benchmark Results (May 7 '25) – Almost..', showing improved benchmark results. The Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview line (green) now curves upward more steeply, closely tracking the projected path of the previous chart. The other models remain capped at Pass@2. The black dotted projection ends again near 100% at Pass@4, as a reference point." 
    class="mx-auto"

Almost..it follows a sub-linear power of x scaling which is pretty common in the recent 'test-time compute' research where scaling the amount of tokens/thinking time/iterations provide large gains, but require exponentially more to get the last few % of possible improvement. 

While the models don't quite get perfect scores, it does show that they *can* get the right answers if given enough time. The economical models of today can score 90-95% if you give them more than 2 tries, while the top of the line models (the same for Gemini) can only get 37% correct on the first try. I think we can expect the next round of models (September-October) to cross into 98% territory with multiple tries, or 50% on the first attempt which means for writing or editing self contained code solutions we're at the point where the AI will be more efficient than writing the code yourself. This doesn't apply along the dimesions of: long codebases, dependency management hell, or secure, performant, easy-to-maintain code (yet) but, **today**, o4-mini and Gemini 2.5 Pro give us a glimpse  of a future where most programming tasks can be automated, freeing developers up for other things.

Which brings us back to the question of, "So what changes now that aider can score 95%?". Over the past month since these models were released, I've noticed that I can hand off more and more tasks to Github's Copilot, and things just work! Whereas, before I had to wrangle context, specify the details of the change in detail and ensure to clean up any out of place code to avoid bad context tripping them up. Now, I can say 'The exclamation icon on the left side seems a little off, can you improve the style of the alerts blocks?' and 95% of the time can get what I want on the 2nd or 3rd try. 

Claims of software development agents coming in the second half of 2025 sound more reasonable to me today than they did a month ago. If the major labs can crack 2 or 3 more roadblocks I have no problems imagining a world where for [$2-4k a month (per agent)](https://youtu.be/2kzQM_BUe7E?t=690 "youtube: Anthropic's CFO discusses A-SWE agent in development") you could have 
  1. a coder agent going to work on tasks for you with increasing precision
  2. a project management agent digesting user requirements, helping create, plan, and track software iterations
  3. a small team that keeps the agents on the rails and aligned with the business. 

I don't see the future where we don't have any work, at least not before 2032, but I am excited to see what new software gets built now that it 'can'.

Footnote: I got a bunch of interesting data from this experiment that I'm still sifting through. If you're interested in following along, you can subscribe to my RSS feed here: [rss feed](/index.xml), or follow me on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jayk56.bsky.social) where I'll be posting some more graphics and links. If you're interested in working on similar experiments but aren't sure where to start, get in touch! I have more ideas than time and would love to talk through the details with others that are interested.
