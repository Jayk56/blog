So, I built a pipeline yesterday for my blog and I want to share the process. You might be wondering why I need a pipeline for my blog, wouldn't I just write posts as I have time? The truth is I can come up with topics that I'd like to talk about faster than I can actually sit down to write all of the thoughts that I have down. (OR The truth is I have many ideas for blog posts, but not enough time to run them all down.) For the past year I have been trying to close the loop between having an idea for a topic, building out that idea through experimentation and collecting sources, and then sharing the findings here. This post and the process I'm developing is geared to help decrease the friction in that loop to hopefully close these gaps.

### 1. The Problem: Ideas Outpace Writing
**Main Point**: Jay can come up with blog topics faster than he can sit down and write them — the bottleneck isn't thinking, it's translating thoughts into finished posts.

**Key Talking Points**:
- Ideas come fast, writing comes slow
- The real friction: going from verbal/mental/theoretical → concrete post with examples, photos, lessons
- This is a universal creator problem — needs Jay's specific version of it
- [NEEDS FLESHING OUT]: How many post ideas has Jay lost? What's the backlog look like? A specific example of a post that died on the vine would be powerful here.

**Tone Notes**: Relatable frustration, not complaining — more like "I finally decided to fix this." Conversational, first-person.
