Let me produce it now.\n\n---\n\n# Review: Building a Blog Pipeline with Claude Code and Voice Memos\n\n## Callouts for Jay\n\n### Factual Claims to Verify\n\n- **\"about 1 cent per memo\" (ElevenLabs Scribe v2 cost)**\n  Status: Needs checking\n  How to verify: Check ElevenLabs pricing page for Scribe v2 speech-to-text rates; calculate based on typical voice memo length\n  Impact if wrong: Low — ballpark is fine but readers may try to replicate\n\n- **\"I expect the cost to continue to drop... 2 hours of 'thought' per day every day for a whole year and it would only cost ~$40. This is with a 10x improvement in cost\"**\n  Status: Needs checking — the math and the prediction\n  How to verify: Calculate: 2hrs/day × 365 days = 730 hours. At current rates, what does 730 hours cost? Then check if $40 at 10x reduction is consistent. Also — is predicting a 10x cost drop in one year reasonable?\n  Impact if wrong: Medium — making a specific numerical prediction that readers will check\n\n- **\"You've been able to run claude in the background like this for about a year\" (Claude CLI background/headless mode availability)**\n  Status: Needs checking\n  How to verify: Check Claude Code CLI release timeline — when did headless/non-interactive mode become available? February 2026 minus \"about a year\" = ~February 2025. Was Claude CLI even available then?\n  Impact if wrong: High — Claude Code launched mid-2025 (around May 2025), so \"about a year\" may be an overstatement. This would undermine credibility on a post about using Claude tools.\n\n- **[Link: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) for \"Claude CLI\"**\n  Status: Needs verification that this URL is valid/correct\n  How to verify: Visit the URL — Claude Code docs may be at docs.anthropic.com or a different path\n  Impact if wrong: Medium — broken link in a post about using the tool looks bad\n\n- **[Link: https://openclaw.ai/](https://openclaw.ai/) for \"ClawdBot/MoltBot/OpenClaw\"**\n  Status: Needs verification that this URL is valid and that the naming is correct\n  How to verify: Visit the URL; confirm the project names\n  Impact if wrong: Low — it's a passing reference, but a dead link is still a dead link\n\n- **\"Opus 4.6\" — is this the correct model version?**\n  Status: Needs checking\n  How to verify: Check current Claude model naming — is it \"Opus 4.6\" or something else? Anthropic's naming conventions have shifted.\n  Impact if wrong: Medium — readers who use Claude will notice immediately\n\n---\n\n### Missing or Broken Links\n\n- **[SCREENSHOT: Example transcript output from ElevenLabs Scribe v2]** at Step 2 — Placeholder still in draft, no image provided\n- **[SCREENSHOT: Example outline generated by Claude CLI preprocessing step]** at Step 3 — Placeholder still in draft, no image provided\n- **[SCREENSHOT: Claude Code CLI documentation on headless mode]** at Step 3 — This is written as `[SCREENSHOT: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/cli-usage \"Claude Code CLI documentation on headless mode\"]` — note the URL here differs from the `code.claude.com` link used earlier. Which is the correct docs URL?\n- **[SCREENSHOT: Claude Cowork introduction screen from Anthropic blog]** at Observations section — Placeholder still in draft\n- **[EMBED: https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview]** at Observations section — Placeholder still in draft. Will this embed resolve? Hugo needs a shortcode or raw HTML for embeds.\n- **Link to Claude Cowork**: The text mentions `[Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork)` — verify this URL is correct. Cowork may be at a different path.\n- **Missing link**: \"I recently organized my posts by 'inbox', 'next', and 'posted'\" — no link or explanation of this system. Is this a separate post? An internal tool? Readers may want context.\n\n---\n\n### Screenshots & Embeds Still Needed\n\n- [ ] **[SCREENSHOT: Example transcript output]** — Step 2 — Jay to take (show what Scribe v2 produces from a voice memo)\n- [ ] **[SCREENSHOT: Example outline from preprocessing]** — Step 3 — Jay to take (show Claude CLI output)\n- [ ] **[SCREENSHOT: Claude Code CLI docs on headless mode]** — Step 3 — URL provided, can be collected by agent\n- [ ] **[SCREENSHOT: Claude Cowork intro screen]** — Observations section — URL provided, can be collected by agent\n- [ ] **[EMBED: Cowork blog post]** — Observations section — Need to confirm Hugo can handle this embed format; may need a shortcode\n- [ ] `folders.jpeg` — Verify this exists in the post's assets. Referenced at top of post.\n- [ ] `ios-shortcut.jpeg` — Verify this exists. Referenced in Step 1.\n- [ ] `editor.png` — Verify this exists. Referenced near end of post.\n- [ ] `image.png` — Verify this exists. Referenced in Cowork observations section. **Also: \"image.png\" is a very generic filename** — consider renaming to something descriptive like `cowork-file-list.png`.\n\n---\n\n### Sections That Sound \"AI-Generated\"\n\n**Opening paragraph, last sentence**:\n\"This post is about the system I built to make that easier.\"\n→ This is fine but generic. The rest of the opening is strong and personal. This closing sentence could be cut — the reader already knows what the post is about.\n\n**\"The Idea\" section**:\n\"Instead of fighting the bottleneck of turning my voice memos into usable drafts I decided to do what any software developer would do when faced with a universal problem and build custom software!\"\n→ The \"universal problem\" framing is a bit hand-wavy. In the transcript you said \"the biggest roadblock to me is translating the thought as it comes out verbally, mentally, and theoretically into a concrete post.\" That's more specific and more Jay.\n\n**\"The Idea\" section, technology paragraph**:\n\"As part of this process I tried a few different technologies, most of which I was familiar with, but also hadn't fully explored the limits of (and still haven't). All around, the stack was built around proving out the workflow and capabilities with the subscriptions I'm already paying for.\"\n→ This is meandering. It reads like filler before getting to the interesting parts. The actual point — \"I limited myself to tools I already pay for\" — is buried. Consider cutting the first sentence entirely and leading with the constraint.\n\n**Step 5 — Post-processing**:\n\"I am working with a review agent to review the content for clarity, grammar, and spelling mistakes. It goes through the post looking for claims I make to make sure they are substantiated and references are provided.\"\n→ This reads like a product description, not Jay talking about his experience. Compare to how you describe the capture step (specific, with friction points). This step has no personality or friction — suspicious for something that presumably had some.\n\n**Cowork observations, opening**:\n\"In the interface you are given a list of chats on the left, the main conversation in the center, and on the right you have the task list + working files + context.\"\n→ Reads like documentation, not a blog post. You don't need to describe the UI layout — show a screenshot and talk about what it's *like* to use. Your transcript is much better here: \"one thing I don't really like about the CoWork workspace is how cluttered the file system gets.\"\n\n**Cowork observations, security paragraph**:\n\"By default, the cowork agent has access to the folder you select along with some MCP connectors and the ability to search the web. It's not able to send data out except to a whitelist as it runs inside of a local VM which means it's not able to run scripts that depend on API access.\"\n→ Again, product documentation tone. Unless you're specifically reviewing the security model, this can be condensed to one sentence or cut. The interesting observation is buried: that the VM sandboxing prevented you from running pipeline scripts that need API access.\n\n---\n\n### Missing Personal Context or Examples\n\n- **Step 2 — Transcribe**: \"The transcription is correct even with all of my lingo\" — What lingo? Give an example! \"Scribe v2 correctly transcribed 'Kustomize' and 'MCP connectors' without me spelling them out\" would be much more vivid and useful to readers.\n\n- **Step 3 — Preprocess**: No example of what the outline looks like. This is the step that would sell the pipeline to readers — show them the magic. A before (raw transcript) → after (structured outline) comparison would be powerful.\n\n- **Step 4 — Manual Draft**: \"Often this turns into a very different post than the one that I had started with\" — Can you give a specific example from *this* post? Since this post IS the test case, saying \"for example, I started by talking about X but realized the real story was Y\" would ground this.\n\n- **Cost projection in Step 2**: The $40/year projection is interesting but comes out of nowhere. What's your *current* cost? \"This post's four voice memos cost me about $0.04 to transcribe\" would anchor the projection in reality.\n\n- **The editor**: \"I had Claude Code build one (granted I then spent a few hours iterating on it to fix all the bugs/feature requests)\" — This is a whole story condensed into a parenthetical! How many iterations? What were the worst bugs? This is \"building software with AI\" content that your readers would love.\n\n---\n\n### Tone/Voice Inconsistencies\n\n- **\"As part of this process I tried a few different technologies, most of which I was familiar with, but also hadn't fully explored the limits of (and still haven't).\"** — Overly hedged and meandering. Your transcript voice is much more direct: \"we had to build a shortcut today.\" Say what you used and why.\n\n- **\"For example, I limited myself to coding with Claude Code and Claude Cowork using Opus 4.6 to better understand how these tools interact with eachother.\"** — \"interact with each other\" is vague. What does that mean specifically? What were you trying to learn?\n\n- **\"They have built plugins and skills which are available for knowledge work and it seems to be fairly competent in editing Word / Excel / PowerPoint files in the same way Claude can.\"** — \"it seems to be fairly competent\" is hedging that doesn't match Jay's typical confident-but-honest style. Either you tested it and can say something specific, or cut it.\n\n- **\"The framing they give is each conversation is a 'Task', which is a suggestion more than a rule, but the further you drift from this the more friction you'll start to notice.\"** — This is a genuinely interesting observation but it's buried in a paragraph of UI description. Pull this out and give it room to breathe.\n\n- **\"I also setup a `claude` background agent for the first time with the goal of increasing this type of background agent use in future projects.\"** — \"with the goal of increasing this type of background agent use\" is corporate-speak. In Jay's voice this would be more like: \"I also ran a `claude` background agent for the first time — something I want to do more of.\"\n\n---\n\n### Fact-Checking Against Transcript\n\n- **Step 1 — Capture**: Draft says \"We use this to save our voice memos to a blog-specific folder in iCloud.\" Transcript says \"it saves it to a iCloud Drive location.\" Minor but: the transcript also says \"You give it the folder name that you wanna save the voice memo to, and then it syncs it over to your, or to my PC.\" The draft captures this but the detail about being prompted for folder name could be clearer — it's the source of the friction Jay identified.\n\n- **Step 1 — Capture, point 3**: \"I had Claude generate step by step instructions for setting this up that were detailed enouch to follow and you was able to chat with it as I went to clarify settings I wasn't familiar with\"\n  → **Typos**: \"enouch\" → \"enough\", \"you was\" → \"I was\". But also — this is NOT in the transcript. This appears to be a new detail added during drafting, which is fine, but it reads like it was drafted quickly and not proofread.\n\n- **Cron job frequency**: Transcript (Recording 38) says \"it will transcribe the files that come from iCloud once every two hours.\" Draft says \"every 15 minutes\" for the sync job. These might be different jobs (sync vs. transcribe), but it's confusing — clarify which job runs at which frequency.\n\n- **\"runs experiments\"**: The draft mentions \"Autonomously running experiments through tools like Codex and Claude Code\" as a future goal. The transcript is vaguer: \"running experiments, that will then generate results that can be included in the post.\" The draft makes this sound more concrete than the transcript suggests. This is fine as aspirational content, but readers may expect more detail.\n\n- **CoWork observations — can't manually edit files**: Draft says \"you can't manually edit files in Cowork, just view them.\" This is NOT explicitly stated in the transcript — it's implied by \"I have to then leave the Cowork tool... I gotta open up another editor.\" Verify this is actually true as a product limitation vs. Jay just not finding the feature.\n\n- **\"Since last August, I've favored Codex for coding projects\"**: Not in transcript. Added context from Jay's drafting, which is fine, but the claim is specific enough that readers familiar with Jay may check — make sure the timeline is accurate.\n\n- **Missing from draft that's in transcript**: Jay's transcript (Recording 39) mentions wanting to \"collect statistics on your chat, so things like length of conversation and number of files edited, created, et cetera.\" This didn't make it into the draft. Intentional omission or oversight?\n\n---\n\n## Section 2: Draft with Inline Comments\n\n+++\ntitle = 'Building a Blog Pipeline with Claude Code and Voice Memos'\ndate = 2026-02-08T02:30:38.640Z\ndraft = true\ntags = [\"ai\", \"claude cowork\", \"automation\", \"blogging\", \"workflow\"]\n+++\n\nSo, I built a pipeline yesterday for my blog and I want to share the process. You might be wondering why I need a 'pipeline for my blog', wouldn't I just write posts as I have time? The truth is I can come up with topics that I'd like to talk about faster than I can actually sit down to write them. For the past year I've been trying to get better at going from 'I have an idea' to 'here's a published post about it.' This post is about the system I built to make that easier.\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: Strong opening — personal and relatable. Last sentence is a bit generic though. Consider cutting it; the reader already knows what the post is about from the title + first few sentences. -->\n\nI recently organized my posts by 'inbox', 'next', and 'posted' - here are the counts:\n{{< figure src=\"folders.jpeg\" alt=\"Blog post folders organized by inbox, next, and posted status\" class=\"mx-auto\" >}}\nMost of those 9 posts in the inbox have been sitting there for 9+ months. Just waiting to be finalized. \n\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify folders.jpeg exists in the post assets. Also: \"9 posts in the inbox\" — is this still accurate as of publication? If you've shipped some since writing this draft, update the number. -->\n\nWhat parts are high friction currently?\n1. Collecting screenshots\n2. Conducting experiments or building software\n3. Pulling graphics from collected raw data like in the [Aider Polyglot](posts/aider-polyglot-saturated/)\n4. Outlining the structure of the post\n\nMost of these can be achieved with some light-automation with agents, so that's what we're going to build!\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"light-automation with agents\" undersells what you actually built. The pipeline has cron jobs, API calls, a custom editor, and multiple agent stages. Consider: \"Most of these can be automated with agents, so that's what I built.\" -->\n\nThe Idea: Use Claude Code + Voice Memos as a Pipeline\n\nInstead of fighting the bottleneck of turning my voice memos into usable drafts I decided to do what any software developer would do when faced with a universal problem and build custom software! Joking aside, I had been inspired by some of the stories I had seen with [ClawdBot/MoltBot/OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), but I'm not ready to hook up everything to an agent just yet, so this is an experiment in smaller automations as well as a tool to help me write.\n\n<!-- TONE: \"faced with a universal problem\" is vague. Your transcript nails it better: \"the biggest roadblock to me is translating the thought as it comes out verbally, mentally, and theoretically into a concrete post.\" Use that specificity. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify https://openclaw.ai/ resolves and that \"ClawdBot/MoltBot/OpenClaw\" are correct names. -->\n\nAs part of this process I tried a few different technologies, most of which I was familiar with, but also hadn't fully explored the limits of (and still haven't). All around, the stack was built around proving out the workflow and capabilities with the subscriptions I'm already paying for. For example, I limited myself to coding with Claude Code and Claude Cowork using Opus 4.6 to better understand how these tools interact with eachother. Since last August, I've favored Codex for coding projects so this was a chance to review the progress in Anthropic's tools. I also setup a `claude` background agent for the first time with the goal of increasing this type of background agent use in future projects. For transcription I chose ElevenLabs [Scribe V2](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview/models#scribe-v2) Speech-to-Text model as I have credits included in my monthly subscription and I'm looking at using some of their generation products this year. \n\n<!-- TONE: This whole paragraph is meandering. Consider restructuring: lead with the constraint (\"I only used tools I already pay for\"), then list them with one sentence each on why. Cut \"most of which I was familiar with, but also hadn't fully explored the limits of (and still haven't)\" — it says nothing. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"Opus 4.6\" — verify this is the correct model name. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"eachother\" → \"each other\" (two words) -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"setup\" → \"set up\" (verb form needs two words) -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"Since last August, I've favored Codex\" — verify timeline accuracy. -->\n\nHere are some things we were able to get working (we'll probably need to improve these)\n1. Collecting screenshots\n2. Transcribing voice memos into workable text\n3. Creating a structured outline of the post based on transcripts\n\nEventually, I'd like the agent to do more magic behind the scenes, some ideas I'll be trying are:\n1. Autonomously running experiments through tools like Codex and Claude Code\n2. Identifying key graphics needed for the post outline and then pulling them from the available data\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"do more magic behind the scenes\" is hand-wavy. What does \"autonomously running experiments\" mean in practice? The outline flagged this too — clarify or cut. -->\n\nHere's what I ended up with for version 1:\n\n```\nCAPTURE               TRANSCRIBE              PRE-PROCESS            DRAFT\n┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐       ┌────────────────┐    ┌──────────┐\n│  Voice      │  →   │  ElevenLabs  │  →    │  Agent: Parse  │ → │  Human   │\n│  Memos      │      │  Scribe v2   │       │  + Outline     │   │  Create  │\n│  + Links    │      │              │       │                │   │  Draft   │\n└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘       └────────────────┘    └──────────┘\n   QUEUE                 QUEUE                   QUEUE               QUEUE\naudio-notes/            output/               output/             output/\n<slug>/                 transcribe/           outline/            draft/\n                        <slug>/               <slug>/             <slug>/\n\n\nREVIEW                 COLLECT                PUBLISH\n┌──────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐\n│  Agent:      │      │  Playwright  │       │  Move to site   │\n│  Review &    │  →   │  + oEmbed +  │  →    │                 │\n│  Callouts    │      │  Cowork      │       │ content/posts/  │\n└──────────────┘      └──────────────┘       │ <slug>/         │\n  QUEUE                 QUEUE                 └─────────────────┘\noutput/              output/\nreview/              collect/\n<slug>/              <slug>/\n```\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: Love the ASCII diagram — very Jay. But it's detailed enough that a casual reader may glaze over. Consider adding a one-sentence summary before it: \"The pipeline has six stages: capture, transcribe, preprocess, draft, review, collect, and publish.\" (That's seven, and your diagram shows seven — the intro says six. Reconcile the count.) -->\n\nStep 1 - Capture:\nI was already capturing ideas and thoughts through voice memo on my phone, but sadly, the built-in transcription feature still struggles with a lot of the software related terms I use. So, I needed to get them to a device that could call a transcription endpoint. So we built a shortcut to send the voice memos to. This is a feature I wasn't aware of, but you can use the built in share feature to send files/media/text as input for your shortcuts. We use this to save our voice memos to a blog-specific folder in iCloud. The user is prompted for the folder name (in this case it is cowork-blog-automation) and the files are synced over to my macbook. \n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"So, I needed to get them to a device that could call a transcription endpoint. So we built a shortcut...\" — two \"So\"s in a row. Tighten: \"I needed them on a device that could call a transcription API, so I built an iOS shortcut.\" -->\n\nThis took some tinkering to get right and there are still frictions in using the system. Here are some notes if you want to setup a similar automation:\n1. On the target computer you have to mark the folder as 'downloaded all the time' otherwise icloud just keeps a stub\n2. If you use text input for the save location you have to remember where you saved the last file which can be difficult if you're working on multiple posts/ideas at once\n3. I had Claude generate step by step instructions for setting this up that were detailed enouch to follow and you was able to chat with it as I went to clarify settings I wasn't familiar with\n\n<!-- REVIEW: Point 3 has typos: \"enouch\" → \"enough\", \"you was\" → \"I was\". This reads like it wasn't proofread — fix before publishing. -->\n<!-- SUGGESTION: Point 3 is interesting! The idea that you can use Claude as a live setup guide while configuring something is worth a sentence or two more. Right now it reads like a throwaway. -->\n\n{{< figure src=\"ios-shortcut.jpeg\" alt=\"iOS Shortcut workflow for saving voice memos to iCloud Drive\" class=\"mx-auto\" >}}\n\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify ios-shortcut.jpeg exists in post assets. -->\n\n \nStep 2 — Transcribe:\nOn my macbook I now have a job that runs every 15 minutes and it syncs the audio-notes folder from iCloud to my blog's pipeline folder. It then calls out to Scribe v2 to get a transcript (about 1 cent per memo) and saves that for processing. \n\n<!-- QUESTION: Transcript says the transcription job runs \"once every two hours.\" Draft says \"every 15 minutes.\" Are these different jobs (sync vs. transcribe)? If so, clarify which runs at which frequency. If the frequency changed, mention that. -->\n\nOne thing that excites me about this transcription is I expect the cost to continue to drop + accuracy improve so that by this time next year I should be able to transcribe 2 hours of 'thought' per day every day for a whole year and it would only cost ~$40. This is with a 10x improvement in cost, but we could see even more of a reduction. \n\n<!-- REVIEW: Check the math — 2hrs/day × 365 = 730 hours. What's the current cost per hour? Does a 10x improvement land at ~$40? Show your work so readers can follow the logic. -->\n<!-- SUGGESTION: Anchor this projection: \"This post's four voice memos cost me [X cents] to transcribe. At that rate...\" -->\n\n[SCREENSHOT: Example transcript output from ElevenLabs Scribe v2 showing a voice memo transcription]\n\n<!-- CONTENT: Screenshot still needed. This is important — showing transcript quality would sell the pipeline to readers. -->\n\nStep 3 — Preprocess:\nNext we have another cron job that finds transcripts for specific blog posts and automatically starts preprocessing with the [Claude CLI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) to generate an outline. You've been able to run claude in the background like this for about a year, but this is my first automated use of it. The price per capabilities should again see at least a 10x improvement over the next year so even if we need to switch to an API it should again be cents or fractions of cents per post.\n\n<!-- REVIEW: \"You've been able to run claude in the background like this for about a year\" — Claude Code launched around May 2025. In February 2026 that's ~9 months, not \"about a year.\" Verify the timeline. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview is the correct URL. The screenshot placeholder later references docs.anthropic.com — which is it? -->\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"The price per capabilities should again see at least a 10x improvement\" is awkward phrasing. Try: \"The cost should drop at least 10x over the next year\" -->\n\n[SCREENSHOT: Example outline generated by Claude CLI preprocessing step]\n[SCREENSHOT: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/cli-usage \"Claude Code CLI documentation on headless mode\"]\n\n<!-- CONTENT: Two screenshots still needed. The outline example is important for showing the pipeline's value. -->\n\nStep 4 — Manual Draft:\nThis is the part I'm working on now (well, the now when I write this, not the now when I post this, or the now when I review this). Here I sit down with the generated outline and write the first draft of the post. I clarify further what I've learned and what I'd like to say, armed with a structure that was laid out from a series of voice memos. Often this turns into a very different post than the one that I had started with as the process of writing / editing my thoughts forces me to probe my understanding to make sure I communicate clearly what I mean.\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: The parenthetical about \"now\" is fun and very Jay. But the rest of this section is abstract. Since this post IS the test case, give a concrete example: \"For example, I started this post focused on the automation, but as I drafted I realized the Cowork observations deserved their own section.\" -->\n\nStep 5 — Post-processing:\nNow that I've written the first draft (different now than before), I am working with a review agent to review the content for clarity, grammar, and spelling mistakes. It goes through the post looking for claims I make to make sure they are substantiated and references are provided. It catches when I try to slip a run on sentence in and helps point out when I need to rework a section. \n\n<!-- TONE: This reads like a feature list, not Jay's experience. Where's the friction? The surprise? Compare to how you described the capture step — full of specific gotchas. What does the review agent actually do well? What does it miss? \"It catches when I try to slip a run on sentence in\" is good personality — more of that. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"run on sentence\" → \"run-on sentence\" (needs hyphen) -->\n\nStep 6 — Iteration:\nThen we go through the regular edit/review/rewrite process for posts, hopefully this will speed up as I practice more and the initial drafts start closer to final drafts.\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: This is thin. One sentence of \"we iterate\" doesn't tell the reader anything. Either expand with what iteration looks like (how many rounds? what changes between rounds?) or fold this into Step 5. -->\n\nFor what I described above I worked through [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) to build the scripts and provide the commands to setup the sync and preprocessing jobs. I'll go into a bit more detail on that process below because it was both magical and frustrating at times.\n\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify https://claude.com/product/cowork URL. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"setup\" → \"set up\" (verb form) -->\n\nThis post is actually the first test of this process, everything I've talked about was first spoken into a voice memo, copied + transcribed, and then drafted to an outline. Like I mentioned before, I had some friction with the iOS shortcut where I realized we need a better way to select the post folder than a simple text input. This is still a todo item. \n\nOne thing I hope you take away from this is you can just ask for software with the latest version of AI tooling. Every time I run into a point of friction I'm a prompt or three away from removing the problems. For example, I noticed when it was time to work on the first draft that it would be good to have an editor with access to my notes / outline / transcripts, so I had Claude Code build one (granted I then spent a few hours iterating on it to fix all the bugs/feature requests). Then when I noticed I was taking screenshots and didn't have a quick way to put them into my draft, we added a feature for that! Right now this still requires a bit of know how on my end, but by the end of 2026 anyone should be able to get these kind of results with a short tutorial. \n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"you can just ask for software\" is a great insight and the best paragraph in the post. But the editor story is compressed into a parenthetical. This deserves 2-3 more sentences. What did you ask for? How long did the first version take to generate? What were the bugs? This is the stuff your readers (who are trying Claude Code themselves) want to know. -->\n\n{{< figure src=\"editor.png\" alt=\"Custom blog draft editor built with Claude Code, showing outline, transcript, and notes panels alongside the markdown editor\" class=\"mx-auto\" >}}\n\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify editor.png exists in post assets. -->\n\nI started this project Friday afternoon, and by the end of the weekend I have the automation running like I'd expect: the automated process of copy the voice memo from my iCloud Drive to my MacBook, transcribe it with ElevenLabs, and then use the Claude CLI to pre-process those notes into an outline works. The transcription is correct even with all of my lingo which is a big time save and I don't need to 'do' anything to get from voice memos to outline anymore. Will this actually save me time? I think so, but the answer is going to come in future posts, I'm certainly going to spend *more* time writing, but writing is the important part, and I no longer have the excuse to put it off because I know there are a hundred small tasks that stand between idea -> post.\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"the transcription is correct even with all of my lingo\" — give an example! \"Scribe v2 nailed 'Kustomize', 'MCP connectors', and 'oEmbed' without me spelling anything out\" would be so much more concrete. -->\n<!-- SUGGESTION: This paragraph is doing double duty as both \"results\" and \"reflection.\" Consider splitting: results first (it works, transcription is good, timeline), then reflection (will it save time? the real value is removing excuses). -->\n\nNow for some observations on Claude Cowork:\n\n[SCREENSHOT: https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview \"Claude Cowork introduction screen from Anthropic blog\"]\n[EMBED: https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview]\n\n<!-- CONTENT: Screenshot and embed still needed. Also: will the Hugo embed shortcode work with this URL? You may need a figure or link instead. -->\n\nIn the interface you are given a list of chats on the left, the main conversation in the center, and on the right you have the task list + working files + context. By default, the cowork agent has access to the folder you select along with some MCP connectors and the ability to search the web. It's not able to send data out except to a whitelist as it runs inside of a local VM which means it's not able to run scripts that depend on API access. They have built plugins and skills which are available for knowledge work and it seems to be fairly competent in editing Word / Excel / PowerPoint files in the same way Claude can. The framing they give is each conversation is a 'Task', which is a suggestion more than a rule, but the further you drift from this the more friction you'll start to notice. \n\n<!-- TONE: This whole paragraph reads like product documentation, not Jay's blog. Your readers can find the feature list on Anthropic's site. What they can't get anywhere else is YOUR experience using it. Lead with the task-framing insight (that's interesting and original) and cut or heavily condense the feature rundown. -->\n\nThe good, I really enjoyed kicking off the project in the cowork tab and I think the fact it is able to work inside existing folders and still use most of the tools available to claude is useful. I also appreciate the security defaults preventing unwanted egress and limiting the blast radius if something goes wrong. There's a lot of potential for the claude desktop app to become *the* entry point for computer use, but I think there are some pieces missing.\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: \"limiting the blast radius if something goes wrong\" is good phrasing. But \"the good\" as a section intro is abrupt. Could transition better from the feature overview. -->\n\nThe first point of friction that I noticed was there's no folder structure in the working files list, i.e. there's no grouping and no hierarchy to quickly understand which file is which if they have similar or the same name. Folders tend to help us reduce cognitive load since properly structured folders allow you to think a lot less about relationships. This is where I think keeping a conversation at the task level would give you some benefits. Limiting the files you're working on/with helps give you that same cognitive boost. I would have liked a similar interface but with the project level abstractions necessary to keep one conversation through idea -> implementation -> validation. Another interesting friction I noticed is that you can't manually edit files in Cowork, just view them. This had the effect of forcing me out of Cowork to write my draft blog posts and to edit files by hand. This is where I had the idea to have Claude Code build me an editor which it did (see below). Here again I found myself hitting some friction, I had the editor project started in Cowork and I wanted to use full Claude Code to work on implementing features and fixing bugs, but there is no 'transfer' to Claude Code option for conversations. Here again I had to have it create project docs in the file system and then load those into claude code when I launched a new session there. \n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: This is the strongest section in the post — genuine product insight with specific friction points. But it's one giant paragraph. Break it into smaller chunks. Three distinct observations here: (1) no folder hierarchy, (2) can't edit files, (3) no conversation transfer between Cowork and Code. Each deserves its own paragraph. -->\n<!-- REVIEW: \"you can't manually edit files in Cowork, just view them\" — verify this is actually true as a product limitation. Your transcript implies it but doesn't state it explicitly. If Cowork does have editing and you missed it, this becomes an embarrassing callout. -->\n<!-- SUGGESTION: The \"properly structured folders allow you to think a lot less\" insight from your transcript is gold. Consider making it a pull quote or callout. -->\n\n{{< figure src=\"image.png\" alt=\"Claude Cowork interface showing file list and working environment\" class=\"mx-auto\" >}}\n\n<!-- REVIEW: Verify image.png exists. Rename to something descriptive — \"image.png\" tells the reader nothing and looks unpolished. Suggest: \"cowork-interface.png\" or \"cowork-files.png\". -->\n\nI think in the future we'll likely see a 'Project' tab that takes the project functionality that Anthropic has and extends it with agents the same way they are doing with Code and Cowork, but for now that's still something we get to do manually.\n\nUnless... \\[to be continued\\]\n\n<!-- SUGGESTION: The \"Unless... [to be continued]\" ending is playful but may frustrate readers who expect a conclusion. If there IS a Part 2 coming, say so explicitly: \"In Part 2, I'll show you...\" If there isn't, consider a more satisfying close — your transcript has a great line: \"I no longer have the excuse to put it off.\" That's a strong ending. -->\n<!-- QUESTION: Is this actually a multi-part series? The outline raised this question. If yes, set up Part 2. If no, write a real ending. -->\n\n---\n\n## Readiness Assessment\n\n**Readiness Score: 2.5/5**\n\n**What's working**:\n- Strong personal voice in the opening and the \"you can just ask for software\" section\n- The pipeline diagram is clear and informative\n- Cowork observations are genuine product insight that readers won't find elsewhere\n- The meta quality (building the post with the pipeline) is a compelling hook\n- Good practical tips in the capture section (iCloud gotchas, folder naming)\n- The Aider Polyglot link is verified and correct\n\n**What needs work before publication**:\n- **4 screenshot/embed placeholders** still in the draft with no images provided\n- **Several typos and grammar issues**: \"enouch\", \"you was\", \"eachother\", \"setup\" (as verb), \"run on sentence\"\n- **Cron job frequency contradiction**: transcript says 2 hours, draft says 15 minutes — needs reconciliation\n- **Claude CLI timeline claim** (\"about a year\") likely inaccurate — Claude Code launched ~May 2025\n- **Multiple unverified external links** (openclaw.ai, code.claude.com, claude.com/product/cowork)\n- **Cowork observations section** is partly product documentation — needs to be rewritten in Jay's voice\n- **Step 5 and Step 6** are thin and read like feature descriptions, not experience\n- **\"image.png\"** filename is generic and unprofessional\n- **The ending is ambiguous** — is this a multi-part series or not?\n- **Missing concrete examples** throughout: transcription accuracy examples, cost anchoring, editor build story, specific before/after comparisons\n- **The technology paragraph** in \"The Idea\" section is meandering filler\n\n**Path to publication**:\n1. Fix typos and grammar issues (10 minutes)\n2. Reconcile the cron job frequency discrepancy\n3. Verify or correct the Claude CLI timeline claim\n4. Verify all external links (openclaw.ai, code.claude.com, cowork URL)\n5. Provide the 4 missing screenshots/embeds, or remove the placeholders\n6. Rename `image.png` to something descriptive\n7. Rewrite the Cowork UI description paragraph — lead with experience, not features\n8. Break the long Cowork observation paragraph into 3 focused paragraphs\n9. Add concrete examples: transcription lingo, cost per memo, editor build story\n10. Expand or cut Steps 5-6\n11. Decide: multi-part series with a proper \"Part 2 coming\" ending, or single post with a real conclusion\n12. Tighten the technology/tools paragraph in \"The Idea\" section\n13. One final read-through for voice consistency\n\n**Estimated effort**: 60-90 minutes for Jay to address these items. The core content is there, but the draft has enough rough edges and missing pieces that it needs a real editing pass, not just a quick polish.\n\n---\n\n## Promotion Ideas\n\n**Short Bluesky teaser** (under 300 chars):\n\"I can come up with blog post ideas way faster than I can write them. So I built a pipeline: voice memo → transcription → AI outline → draft → review. This post was the first test. Here's what worked and what didn't.\"\n\n**Medium tease** (thread starter):\n\"spent the weekend building a voice-to-blog pipeline with Claude Code. Record a voice memo on my phone, it auto-transcribes with ElevenLabs, Claude turns it into an outline, then I write the actual post. The meta part: this post about the pipeline was made WITH the pipeline 🔄\"\n\n**Angle 1** (Builder/maker):\n\"I had Claude Code build me a custom blog editor in an afternoon. Then when I needed screenshot management, I asked for that too. We're at the point where you can just... ask for software. New post on what that looks like in practice.\"\n\n**Angle 2** (Productivity/writing):\n\"I have 9 blog post ideas sitting unfinished for 9+ months. The problem was never ideas — it was all the friction between 'I know what I want to say' and 'published post.' So I automated the tedious parts.\"\n\n**Angle 3** (Product observation):\n\"Used Claude Cowork for a full weekend project. Loved kicking things off there, but hit real friction: no folder hierarchy, can't edit files, no way to transfer a conversation to Claude Code. Wrote up my findings.\"\n\n**Best time to post**: Weekday morning (Tues-Thurs, 9-11am ET) — developer/AI audience is most active.
