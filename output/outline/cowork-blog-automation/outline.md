It looks like the file write permission needs to be granted. But here's a summary of the update I'm trying to save:

---

**Outline updated (v2) for `cowork-blog-automation`** — integrating Recording 40.

### What changed from Recording 40:

Recording 40 is short but adds a concrete, relatable finding: Jay was taking screenshots on his phone AND computer while drafting, had no idea where to put them, and built a drag-and-drop asset area into the draft editor to solve it.

### Where it was integrated:

| Location | Change | Tag |
|---|---|---|
| **Section 3 (Pipeline), Step 4** | Added asset management sub-point under Manual Draft step — the drag-and-drop solution | `[EXPANDED]` |
| **Section 5 (Findings)** | New bullet: "Asset management gap during drafting" as a finding, framed as pipeline evolving in real-time | `[EXPANDED]` |
| **Section 7 title** | Renamed from "Background Collection and Scheduling" → "Background Collection and Asset Management" | `[EXPANDED]` |
| **Section 7** | New talking point about ad-hoc asset capture complementing background collection | `[EXPANDED]` |
| **Section 8** | Added "drag-and-drop asset area already built" to What's Next list | — |
| **Key Quotes** | Added new quote: "I was taking screenshots on my phone and screenshots on my computer, and I was not sure where to add them." | `[NEW]` |
| **Screenshot Opportunities** | Added: drag-and-drop asset area in draft editor | `[NEW]` |
| **Callouts** | Checked off "Address asset management" action item; added new action item to screenshot the feature | `[NEW]` |
| **Content Assessment** | Added coverage point #5 (real-time pipeline evolution); updated word count estimate to 2200-3000; updated voice memo count to four | `[EXPANDED]` |
| **Metadata** | Word count bumped from 2000-2800 → 2200-3000, reading time from 8-11 → 9-12 min | — |

Could you grant write permission so I can save the updated outline?
