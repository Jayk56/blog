The follow-up recordings added substantial material — concrete findings from using the pipeline, observations about CoWork's workspace UX, improvement ideas around background collection and asset management, and a shortcut update for folder selection.\n\nHere's a quick summary of what changed:\n\n- **Section 3 (Pipeline)** `[EXPANDED]` — Added iCloud sync gotcha, folder naming friction, asset drag-and-drop feature, and more detail on transcription cron timing\n- **Section 5 (Findings)** `[EXPANDED]` — Filled in with real findings: end-to-end success, four voice memos used, length concerns, asset management gap identified and solved\n- **Section 6 (CoWork Observations)** `[NEW]` — Full new section on file system clutter, navigation, Claude Code comparison, drafting friction, and custom blog software idea\n- **Section 7 (Improvement Ideas)** `[NEW]` — Background collection scheduling, specific screenshot requests, session statistics tracking, ad-hoc asset capture\n- **Key Quotes** — 9 new quotes preserved from recordings 38-41\n- **Screenshot Opportunities** — 7 new items including Jay's specific requests and suggested graphics\n- **Callouts** — Checked off findings action item + asset management fix; added 7 new action items\n- **Content Assessment** — Upgraded from \"thin\" to \"moderate\" coverage; noted the post may need splitting\n\nThe outline is ready for you to review. The biggest open decisions flagged are: (1) whether to split into two parts given the volume of content, (2) how much technical depth to include, and (3) whether the CoWork observations warrant their own section or should fold into findings.","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"a91d8538-33f8-4c0f-a5a2-fc3b133875d7","total_cost_usd":0.10598550000000001,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":14108,"cache_read_input_tokens":15451,"output_tokens":403,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":14108,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":2,"outputTokens":403,"cacheReadInputTokens":15451,"cacheCreationInputTokens":14108,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.10598550000000001,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"8d49678b-3cad-47d7-a4d2-7f8e71d8805f"}
