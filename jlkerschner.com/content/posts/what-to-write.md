## Introduction
Hi there, my name is Jay and this is my corner of the Internet.

I’ll use this blog mainly as a dumping ground for things that are interesting to me and for documenting progress on projects, both personal and professional.

I like computers, coffee and chess. But what I love most is solving puzzles.

Coming from a background in architecture, I have a great appreciation for functional design and the impact it can have on us as people. Solving people’s problems with software allows me to have the biggest impact, but I also enjoy complex, financial analysis as well as building physical structures, architectural design, and most of the creative arts. 

This blog is a long time in the making. I bought the domain about three years ago, intending to get the site up. But, as so often happens to us software folks, I got caught up in the minutia of picking a theme and trying to style things just right before hitting publish. Taking some inspiration from Simon Wilson and his [blog](https://simonwillison.net/) I decided the most important thing was to start getting these ideas out and sharing with the world and I can figure out the rest of the features later. So, this will be an evolving project which I will do my best to document as the site progresses.

Simon also has a great framework for thinking of what to write, in [What to blog about](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/), he breaks them up into: things I've found, things I've learned, and things I've built (he calls this one 'descriptions of my projects'). The biggest take away for me is realizing that capturing your notes in a way which others can share benefits you as well as them. I've learned a lot from others who have maintained sites like this and would like to contribute back to the web, (if I can) with my random musings and documentation.
